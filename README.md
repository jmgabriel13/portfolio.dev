# JM Gabriel

Greetings! I'm JM, a Full-Stack developer.

I am a dedicated Full Stack Developer, driven by a passion for creating resilient and user-centered digital solutions.

My expertise spans across server-side development and crafting intuitive user interfaces, employing diverse technology stacks such as C#, .NET Core, MSSQL, and React/Angular, or MongoDB, Express, React, and NodeJS (MERN).

I specialize in designing and building applications tailored to user requirements, leveraging sophisticated Software Architecture and Design principles. This includes implementing methodologies like Clean Architecture or Vertical Slice Architecture, embracing concepts such as Domain-Driven Design, and adopting practices like Command and Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS).
